          3.2 Provide accurate, complete and current information during registration. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Account credentials and for all activity under your Account.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-6">
          3.3 Immediately notify us of any unauthorised use of your Account at info@shapeai.co.uk.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-ink mt-8 mb-4">4. Tokens — nature, pricing structure and display (PRICING STRUCTURE INCLUDED)</h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          4.1 <strong>Nature of Tokens.</strong> Tokens are virtual accounting units used on the Service. Tokens are not cash, e-money, securities or investments and confer only the rights set out in these Terms.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          4.2 <strong>Pricing Structure for Meal Plan Generation (summary).</strong> Token cost for a generation is the sum of: (a) base generation cost determined by the length of your description (words); (b) duration-based cost determined by number of days requested; and (c) additional costs for selected options (Goals, Structure, Diet). The Service displays the full Pricing Structure and worked examples.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          4.3 <strong>Word-length (base) cost.</strong> Base cost = 30 tokens for up to 10 words in the description. Then +10 tokens per each additional block of up to 10 words (rounding up).<br />
          <em>Examples: 0–10 words = 30 tokens; 15 words = 40 tokens; 25 words = 50 tokens.</em>
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          4.4 <strong>Day-based cost.</strong> Day cost = 20 tokens for day 1, plus +20 tokens for each additional day. Maximum days per request: 180 days.<br />
          <em>Examples: 1 day = 20 tokens; 7 days = 140 tokens; 30 days = 600 tokens.</em>
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          4.5 <strong>Options & add-ons.</strong> Examples of option costs (full list on Service): Activity Level +5, Calorie Method +5, Protein Target +5, Meals per day +5, Snacks +5, Intermittent Fasting +10, Leftovers Strategy +10, Diet Type +10 per chosen type, Cuisines +5 per cuisine, Allergens +5 per allergen, Other Exclusions +10 if field filled.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          4.6 <strong>Total cost calculation.</strong><br />
          <code className="bg-neutral-lines/20 px-2 py-1 rounded text-sm">total_tokens = word_cost_tokens + day_cost_tokens + sum(selected_option_token_costs)</code>
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          4.7 <strong>Display & consent.</strong> Prior to confirmation the Service will display a token breakdown (word cost, day cost, each selected add-on) and the total tokens (and, when applicable, fiat equivalent). Fiat amounts are shown with exactly two (2) decimal places. By confirming you authorise deduction of the displayed Tokens from your Account.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          4.8 <strong>Issuance, redemption and transfers.</strong> Tokens are credited to your Account after successful payment. Tokens are typically non-transferable and bound to your Account, unless expressly allowed in writing. Promotional Tokens may have different rules.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-6">
          4.9 <strong>Changes to pricing.</strong> We may change Token pricing or the Pricing Structure at any time; changes apply prospectively to purchases or generation requests made after the change is posted.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-ink mt-8 mb-4">5. Ordering, payment and checkout</h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          5.1 All purchases and generation requests are subject to acceptance. We may refuse or cancel orders for suspected fraud, errors or other valid reasons.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          5.2 Payments are processed through third-party payment providers; we generally do not store full card data. You warrant you are authorised to use the chosen payment method.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          5.3 At checkout you will see: Token quantity, Token nominal value (fiat equivalent), and the total fiat to be charged in the selected purchase currency (EUR, GBP or USD), plus any taxes/fees. Fiat amounts are shown with exactly two (2) decimal places. Confirm these before completing payment.

        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          7.1 If you consented at checkout to immediate supply of digital content and you downloaded or opened it, your statutory right to cancel may be lost for that transaction. See the Refund & Returns Policy for full rules.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-4">
          7.2 Tokens redeemed in a Generation Transaction are generally non-refundable except where: (a) a system error prevented delivery and no output was supplied; (b) the delivered product is materially defective or not as described; or (c) required by law. In such cases we will generally re-credit Tokens or issue a fiat refund for the token value of the affected transaction.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-slate mb-6">
          7.3 For partial failures (e.g., corrupt file) we will offer either a free repeat generation (no extra Tokens) or refund/re-credit for the affected transaction. Support decisions are based on transaction logs and evidence.
